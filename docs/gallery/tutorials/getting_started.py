Getting Started with Alpa
=========================

Alpa is a library that automatically parallelizes jax functions and runs them
on a distributed cluster. Alpa analyses the jax computational graph and generates
a distributed execution plan tailored for the computational graph and target cluster.
Alpa is specifically designed for training large-scale neural networks.
The generated execution plan can combine state-of-the-art distributed training techniques
including data parallelism, operator parallelism, and pipeline parallelism.

Alpa provides a simple API ``@parallelize`` and automatically generates the best execution
plan by solving optimization problems. Therefore, you can efficiently scale your jax
computation to a distributed cluster, without any expertise on distributed computing. 

In this tutorial, we show the usage of Alpa with a MLP example.

# Train a MLP on a single device

# To begin with, we implement the model and training loop on a single devices. We will

# Auto-parallelize with ``@parallelize``
# --------------------------------------
# Alpa provides a transformation ``@alpa.parallelize`` to parallelize a jax function.
# ``@alpa.parallelize`` is similar to ``@jax.jit``. ``@jax.jit`` compiles a jax
# function for a single device, while ``@alpa.parallelize`` compiles a jax function
# for a distributed device cluster.
# You may know that jax has some built-in transformations for parallelization,
# such as ``pmap``, ``pjit``, and ``xmap``. However, these transformations are not
# fully automatic, because they requires users to manually specifiying the parallelization
# strategies such as parallelization axes and device mapping schemes. You also need to
# manually call communication promitives such as ``lax.pmean`` and ``lax.all_gather``.
# Unlike these transformations, ``@alpa.parallelize` can do all things automatically for
# you. You only need to write the code as if you are writing for a single device.

# Transform the function and run it
parallel_train_step = alpa.parallelize(train_step)

actual_state = parallel_train_step(state, batch)

# Test correctness
assert_allclose(expected_state.params, actual_state.params)

################################################################################
# Speed Comparision 
# -----------------
# By parallelizing a jax function, we can accelerate the computation and reduce
# the memory usage per GPU. We benchmark the execution speed of ``@jax.jit`` and
# ``@alpa.parallelize`` on a 8-GPU machine.
