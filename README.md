Alpa is a system for training and serving large-scale neural networks.

Scaling neural networks to hundreds of billions of parameters has enabled dramatic breakthroughs such as GPT-3, but training and serving these large-scale neural networks require complicated distributed system techniques.
Alpa aims to automate large-scale distributed training and serving with just a few lines of code.

The key features of Alpa include:  

ðŸ’» **Automatic Parallelization**. Alpa automatically parallelizes users' single-device code on distributed clusters with data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. 

ðŸš€ **Excellent Performance**. Alpa achieves linear scaling on training models with billions of parameters on distributed clusters.

âœ¨ **Tight Integration with Machine Learning Ecosystem**. Alpa is backed by open-source, high-performance, and production-ready libraries such as [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), and [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

## Quick Start
Use Alpa's decorator ``@parallelize`` to scale your single-device training code to distributed clusters.

```python
import alpa

# Parallelize the training step in Jax by simply using a decorator
@alpa.parallelize
def train_step(model_state, batch):
    def loss_func(params):
        out = model_state.forward(params, batch["x"])
        return jnp.mean((out - batch["y"]) ** 2)

    grads = grad(loss_func)(model_state.params)
    new_model_state = model_state.apply_gradient(grads)
    return new_model_state

# The training loop now automatically runs on your designated cluster
model_state = create_train_state()
for batch in data_loader:
    model_state = train_step(model_state, batch)
```
