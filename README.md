Alpa is a system for training and serving large-scale neural networks.

Scaling neural networks to hundreds of billions of parameters has enabled dramatic breakthroughs such as GPT-3, but training and serving these large-scale neural networks require complicated distributed system techniques.
Alpa aims to automate large-scale distributed training and serving with just a few lines of code.

The key features of Alpa include:  

ðŸ’» **Automatic Parallelization**. Alpa automatically parallelizes users' single-device code on distributed clusters with data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. 

ðŸš€ **Excellent Performance**. Alpa achieves linear scaling on training models with billions of parameters on distributed clusters.

âœ¨ **Tight Integration with Machine Learning Ecosystem**. Alpa is backed by open-source, high-performance, and production-ready libraries such as [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), and [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

## Serving
Alpa provides a free, unlimited OPT-175B text generation service.
Try the service at [https://opt.alpa.ai/](https://opt.alpa.ai/) and share your [prompting results](examples/llm_serving/service/img.png)!

The code below shows how to use huggingface/transformers interface and Alpa distributed backend for large model inference.
Detailed documentation is in [Serving OPT-175B using Alpa](https://alpa.ai/tutorials/opt_serving.html).

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from llm_serving.model.wrapper import get_model

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-2.7b")
tokenizer.add_bos_token = False

# Load the model. Alpa automatically downloads the weights to the specificed path
model = get_model(model_name="alpa/opt-2.7b", path="~/opt_weights/")

# Generate
prompt = "Paris is the capital city of"

input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
output = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids, max_length=256, do_sample=True)
generated_string = tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)

print(generated_string)
```

## Training
Use Alpa's decorator ``@parallelize`` to scale your single-device training code to distributed clusters.
Check out the [documentation](https://alpa-projects.github.io) site and
[examples](https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa/tree/main/examples) folder
for installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and more.

```python
import alpa

# Parallelize the training step in Jax by simply using a decorator
@alpa.parallelize
def train_step(model_state, batch):
    def loss_func(params):
        out = model_state.forward(params, batch["x"])
        return jnp.mean((out - batch["y"]) ** 2)

    grads = grad(loss_func)(model_state.params)
    new_model_state = model_state.apply_gradient(grads)
    return new_model_state

# The training loop now automatically runs on your designated cluster
model_state = create_train_state()
for batch in data_loader:
    model_state = train_step(model_state, batch)
```
