# Language model training examples

The following example showcases how to train a language model from scratch 
using the JAX/Flax backend.

JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU.
Models written in JAX/Flax are **immutable** and updated in a purely functional
way which enables simple and efficient model parallelism.

## Causal language modeling

In the following, we demonstrate how to train an auto-regressive causal transformer model 
in JAX/Flax.
More specifically, we pretrain a randomely initialized [**`gpt2`**](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) model in Norwegian
to pre-train 124M [**`gpt2`**](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)
in Norwegian.

The example script uses the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. You can easily customize them to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.


To setup all relevant files for training, let's create a directory.

```bash
mkdir ./norwegian-gpt2
```

### Train tokenizer

In the first step, we train a tokenizer to efficiently process the text input for the model. Similar to how it is shown in [How to train a new language model from scratch using Transformers and Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train), we use a **`ByteLevelBPETokenizer`**.
The tokenizer is trained on the complete Norwegian dataset of OSCAR
and consequently saved in the cloned model directory.
This can take up to 10 minutes depending on your hardware â˜•.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from tokenizers import trainers, Tokenizer, normalizers, ByteLevelBPETokenizer

# load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("oscar", "unshuffled_deduplicated_no", split="train")

# Instantiate tokenizer
tokenizer = ByteLevelBPETokenizer()

def batch_iterator(batch_size=1000):
    for i in range(0, len(dataset), batch_size):
        yield dataset[i: i + batch_size]["text"]

# Customized training
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(batch_iterator(), vocab_size=50256, min_frequency=2, special_tokens=[
    "<s>",
    "<pad>",
    "</s>",
    "<unk>",
    "<mask>",
])

# Save files to disk
tokenizer.save("./norwegian-gpt2/tokenizer.json")
```

### Create configuration

Next, we create the model's configuration file. This is as simple 
as loading and storing [`**gpt2**`](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)
in the local model folder:

```python
from transformers import GPT2Config

config = GPT2Config.from_pretrained("gpt2", resid_pdrop=0.0, embd_pdrop=0.0, attn_pdrop=0.0, vocab_size=50256)
config.save_pretrained("./norwegian-gpt2")
```

Great, we have set up our model repository. During training, we will now automatically
push the training logs and model weights to the repo.

### Train model

Finally, we can run the example script to pretrain the model:

#### Launch a Ray cluster
1. Use the command below to launch ray on a head node  
  ```ray start --head```
2. (Optional) If you have more nodes, connect them to the head node. The command should look like this, but with the ip address and password printed by the previous command.   
  ```ray start --address='172.31.34.216:6379' --redis-password='5241590000000000'```

##### Run
```bash
python3 run_clm_flax.py \
    --output_dir="./norwegian-gpt2" \
    --model_type="gpt2" \
    --config_name="./norwegian-gpt2" \
    --tokenizer_name="./norwegian-gpt2" \
    --dataset_name="oscar" \
    --dataset_config_name="unshuffled_deduplicated_no" \
    --do_train --do_eval \
    --block_size="512" \
    --per_device_train_batch_size="96" \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size="96" \
    --num_micro_batches="4" \
    --dtype="float16" \
    --learning_rate="1e-3" --warmup_steps="1000" \
    --adam_beta1="0.9" --adam_beta2="0.98" --weight_decay="0.01" \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --num_train_epochs="20" \
    --logging_steps="100" \
    --save_steps="2500" \
    --eval_steps="2500"
```

Training should converge at a loss and perplexity 
of 3.24 and 25.72 respectively after 20 epochs
This should take less than ~21 hours on a single TPUv3-8 or a machine with 8 V100 GPUs.
Training statistics can be accessed on [tfhub.de](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/2zEhLwJ0Qp2FAkI3WVH9qA).
