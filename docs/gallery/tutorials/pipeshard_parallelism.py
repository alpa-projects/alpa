"""
Distributed Training with Both Shard and Pipeline Parallelism
=============================================================

Alpa can automatically parallelizes jax functions with both shard
parallelism (a.k.a. intra-operator parallelism) and pipeline parallelism
(a.k.a. inter-operator parallelism). Shard parallelism includes
data parallelism, operator parallelism, and their combinations.
The :ref:`quick start <Alpa Quickstart>` focuses on using Alpa for shard parallelism.

In this tutorial, we show how to use Alpa with both shard and pipeline parallelism.
First, we show how to use Alpa to manually assign stages for pipeline parallelism.
Then we show how to use Alpa to automate this process.

# Connect to a Ray Cluster
# ------------------------
# Alpa uses a distributed framework `ray <https://docs.ray.io/>`_ to manage
# the cluster and disributed workers. We initialize ray and alpa.

ray.init()
alpa.init(cluster="ray")

# Alternatively, you can use the following command to connect to an existing
# ray cluster.
# ray.init(address="auto")
#
# Note: `alpa.init(cluster="ray")` uses the gpus resources of the whole ray
# cluster. To configure Alpa to only use a subset of gpu resources, one can 
# specific the number of nodes and number of gpus per node.
# For example, only run 2 gpus when 8 gpus are available 
# alpa.init('ray', devices_per_node=2, num_nodes=1)

#   In addition, Alpa supports more flexible manual assignments of pipeline
#   parallelism strategies. In the above example, each partitioned stages will
#   be assigned an equal number of devices to run. If you want to control the
#   device assignment of each stage, you can use the more advanced
#   ``stage_option=alpa.ManualStageOption``.

# Pipeline Parallelism with Automatic Assignment
# ----------------------------------------------
# Alpa also supports automatically partitioning the model into multiple
# pipeline stages and assign each pipeline stage a device mesh such that
# the total execution latency is minimized. Specifically, the automatic
# partitioning algorithm consists of the following steps:
#
# 1. **Layer Construction:** In this step, the operators in the model are
#    clustered into "layers" based on a graph clustering algorithm. The
#    user needs to specify the total number of layers (i.e. clusters) as
#    a hyperparameter.
# 2. **Stage Construction and Mesh Slicing:** In this step, we partition
#    the device cluster (device mesh) to multiple submeshes and assign
#    layers to submeshes to form pipeline stages to minimize the total
#    pipeline execution latency.
