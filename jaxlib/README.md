# Build Jaxlib for Alpa

This folder is mainly copied from https://github.com/google/jax/tree/main/build.
We apply several modifications to make it easier to build the jaxlib with alpa's tensorflow [fork](https://github.com/alpa-projects/tensorflow-alpa).

All modifications are summarized in `customize_build_scripts.patch`.
