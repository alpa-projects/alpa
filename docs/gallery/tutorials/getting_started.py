Getting Started with Alpa
=========================

Alpa is a library that automatically parallelizes jax functions and runs them
on a distributed cluster. Alpa analyses the jax computational graph and generates
a distributed execution plan tailored for the computational graph and target cluster.
Alpa is specifically designed for training large-scale neural networks.
The generated execution plan can combine state-of-the-art distributed training techniques
including data parallelism, operator parallelism, and pipeline parallelism.

Alpa provides a simple API ``@parallelize`` and automatically generates the best execution
plan by solving optimization problems. Therefore, you can efficiently scale your jax
computation on a distributed cluster, without any expertise in distributed computing.

In this tutorial, we show the usage of Alpa with an MLP example.

# Import Libraries
# --------------------
# We first import the required libraries.
# Flax and optax are libraries on top of jax for training neural networks.
# Although we use these libraries in this example, Alpa works at jax level and
# does not depend on these specific libraries.

# Train an MLP on a Single Device

# To begin with, we implement the model and training loop on a single device. We will
# parallelize it later. We train an MLP to learn a function y = Wx + b.

# Auto-parallelization with ``@parallelize``
# ------------------------------------------
# Alpa provides a transformation ``@alpa.parallelize`` to parallelize a jax function.
# ``@alpa.parallelize`` is similar to ``@jax.jit`` . ``@jax.jit`` compiles a jax
# function for a single device, while ``@alpa.parallelize`` compiles a jax function
# for a distributed device cluster.
# You may know that jax has some built-in transformations for parallelization,
# such as ``pmap``, ``pjit``, and ``xmap``. However, these transformations are not
# fully automatic, because they require users to manually specify the parallelization
# strategies such as parallelization axes and device mapping schemes. You also need to
# manually call communication primitives such as ``lax.pmean`` and ``lax.all_gather``,
# which is nontrivial if you want to do advanced model parallelization.
# Unlike these transformations, ``@alpa.parallelize`` can do all things automatically for
# you. You only need to write the code as if you are writing for a single device.

# Transform the function and run it
parallel_train_step = alpa.parallelize(train_step)

actual_state = parallel_train_step(state, batch)

# Test correctness
assert_allclose(expected_state.params, actual_state.params, atol=5e-3)

# The types of parameters in actual_state become `ShardedDeviceArray`,
# which means the parameters are now stored distributedly on multiple devices.
print(type(actual_state.params["params"]["Dense_0"]["kernel"]))

# Execution Speed Comparison
# ---------------------------
# By parallelizing a jax function, we can accelerate the computation and reduce
# the memory usage per GPU, so we can train large models faster.
# We benchmark the execution speed of ``@jax.jit`` and ``@alpa.parallelize``
# on a 8-GPU machine.
